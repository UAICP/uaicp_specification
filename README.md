# Universal AI Communication Protocol (UAICP)

The **Universal AI Communication Protocol (UAICP)** is an open meta-standard framework designed to enable seamless discovery, integration, and communication between diverse AI systems across different providers and platforms. Rather than replacing existing proprietary protocols, UAICP provides a universal translation and discovery layer that leverages the strengths of established standards while ensuring consistent interoperability across the AI ecosystem.

## Overview

UAICP addresses the growing fragmentation in the AI communication landscape by creating a universal bridge between different protocol ecosystems. It allows AI systems using different protocols (such as Anthropic's MCP, Google's A2A, OpenAI's APIs, and others) to discover and communicate with each other seamlessly.

### Key Features

- **Universal Discovery**: Find AI services across protocol boundaries
- **Protocol Translation**: Communicate between different AI protocols
- **Adaptive Routing**: Route requests based on capabilities and performance
- **Capability Negotiation**: Dynamically match capabilities between different systems
- **Security Framework**: Ensure consistent security across diverse protocols

## Documentation

- [Specification](docs/specification/specification.md) - The complete UAICP specification
- [Examples](docs/examples/) - Real-world usage examples and patterns
- [Integration Guides](docs/integration-guides/) - How to integrate UAICP with existing systems
- [Reference Implementations](reference-impl/) - Official reference implementations

## Implementation Status

UAICP is currently in the active development phase. The core specification is stable, but implementations are still evolving.

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Specification | Draft v1.0.0 |
| Universal Discovery Mesh | Reference Implementation |
| Protocol Translation Hub | Interface Definition |
| Adaptive Router | Interface Definition |
| Capability Negotiator | Specification Draft |
