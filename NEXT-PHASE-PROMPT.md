- ✅ 1+ cloud provider native integration

## 🚀 **Recommended Parallel Approach**

### **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): Foundation Building**
- **Primary**: TSC Formation (critical for governance authority)
- **Secondary**: Community Platform Setup (enables parallel development)
- **Supporting**: Begin core implementation planning

### **Phase 2 (Weeks 7-12): Acceleration**
- **Primary**: Core Implementation Development (demonstrates value)
- **Secondary**: Community Growth Programs (builds momentum)
- **Supporting**: Partnership outreach initiation

### **Phase 3 (Weeks 13-24): Scale**
- **Primary**: Partnership Development (industry adoption)
- **Secondary**: Advanced Implementation Features (competitive advantage)
- **Supporting**: Community-driven expansion

## 📞 **Next Steps Decision Framework**
