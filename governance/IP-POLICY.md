# UAICP Intellectual Property Policy

## Overview

The Universal AI Communication Protocol (UAICP) is designed to be an open, implementable standard that promotes AI interoperability while respecting intellectual property rights. This policy establishes clear guidelines for intellectual property contributions, licensing, and usage within the UAICP ecosystem.

## Patent Policy

### FRAND Commitment

All participants in the UAICP standardization process commit to Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) licensing terms for essential patents.

#### Essential Patents Definition
An "Essential Patent" is a patent that:
- Is necessarily infringed by any compliant implementation of the UAICP specification
- Cannot be designed around without significantly compromising the functionality or interoperability of the implementation
- Is owned or controlled by a UAICP participant

#### FRAND Licensing Requirements
- **Fair:** Licensing terms that do not discriminate between implementers
- **Reasonable:** Licensing fees that are proportionate to the economic value contributed
- **Non-Discriminatory:** Equal treatment of all implementers seeking licenses

### Patent Disclosure Requirements

#### Mandatory Disclosure
All UAICP participants must disclose:
- Known essential patents they own or control
- Patent applications that may become essential patents
- Third-party essential patents they are aware of

#### Disclosure Timeline
- **Initial Disclosure:** Within 60 days of joining UAICP
- **Ongoing Disclosure:** Within 30 days of becoming aware of relevant patents
- **Specification Changes:** Before any specification changes that may affect patent landscape

#### Disclosure Format
Patent disclosures must include:
- Patent number and jurisdiction
