# UAICP Governance Framework

## Overview

The Universal AI Communication Protocol (UAICP) is governed as an open standard under the stewardship of the AI Interoperability Foundation. This document establishes the governance structure, decision-making processes, and community participation guidelines for the UAICP specification and ecosystem.

## Governance Principles

1. **Openness**: All governance processes are transparent and publicly accessible
2. **Inclusivity**: Broad participation from diverse stakeholders is encouraged
3. **Consensus-Driven**: Decisions are made through consensus when possible
4. **Technical Merit**: Technical decisions are based on merit and evidence
5. **Community-First**: The needs of the broader AI interoperability community take precedence
6. **Vendor Neutrality**: No single vendor or organization controls the standard
